TinyCrypt Cryptographic Library

Overview
The TinyCrypt Library provides an implementation for targeting constrained devices with a minimal set of standard cryptography primitives, as listed below. To better serve applications targeting constrained devices, TinyCrypt implementations differ from the standard specifications (see the Important Remarks section for some important differences). Certain cryptographic primitives depend on other primitives, as mentioned in the list below.

Aside from the Important Remarks section below, valuable information on the usage, security and technicalities of each cryptographic primitive are found in the corresponding header file.
